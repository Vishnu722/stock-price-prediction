## **Stock Market Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Models**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict stock market prices using various machine learning models. By analyzing historical stock price data, the system builds predictive models to estimate future prices, providing insights for informed decision-making in financial markets.

## **Features:**
1. Implements multiple machine learning models:
    . Linear Regression
    . Random Forest
    . XGBoost
    . Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
2. Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering.
3. Model evaluation based on accuracy and performance metrics.
4. Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices.

## **WorkFlow:**
1. Data Collection: Historical stock price data, including features such as open, close, high, low, and volume.
2. Data Preprocessing:
   . Handling missing values.
   . Normalization and scaling of features.
   . Feature selection for relevant predictors.
3. Model Implementation:
   . Linear Regression: A baseline linear approach.
   . Random Forest: Captures non-linear relationships through ensemble learning.
   . XGBoost: Enhances predictions using gradient boosting.
   . LSTM: A deep learning model for sequential time-series data.
4. Evaluation:
  . Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score.
  . Visualization: Graphical comparison of predicted vs. actual prices.
5. Optimization:
  . Hyperparameter tuning for enhanced model performance.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
* pandas for data manipulation.
+ numpy for numerical computations.
- scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
- xgboost for gradient boosting.
* tensorflow or keras for implementing LSTM.
+ matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

## **Future Work:**
1. Incorporate more complex deep learning models (e.g., Transformer-based architectures).
2. Experiment with external features such as market indices and macroeconomic indicators.
3. Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
